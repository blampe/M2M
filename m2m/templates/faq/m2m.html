<h1> A (Not-So) Brief History of M2M </h1>
<p>So, you want to learn about M2M, do you? Well, we applaud your curiosity. The history of M2M is
a murky thing, full of mystery and gaps; at its beginning, we think, nobody realized that it would
eventually become such a general, school-wide resource. But, we digress. we shall allow one far more
knowledgable than us to speak upon the history of this hallowed domain (his words used without permission):
</p>
<h2> Before SU2010 </h2>
<blockquote><p>The earliest network existed largely through Samba Explorer and some primitive
 and unreliable indexing software. A prolific pornography purveyor, let's call him D, 
 necessitated the need for a better search engine; his excel spreadsheets left a lot 
 to be desired. This led to M2M, which was probably in its second incarnation when I 
 started school (I was actually interviewed by the person who made the original, original 
 M2M - he instantly knew what my resume was hinting at). This M2M was painfully slow as it 
 was just doing LIKE queries, and there was no additional functionality. I think it was using 
 FemFind to do its crawling?</p>
<p> For a networking class, a guy named F made a much faster but still suck-ass M2M, which he 
called M2M2 and which co-existed with the other M2M for a brief period of time. After that 
original M2M disappeared several smaller, less well-known M2Ms surfaced, most notably from W and 
R -- who briefly gave West the ability to queue up music on the speakers from within M2M. M2M2 
ultimately won the popularity race, however, and the school embraced it.</p>
<p>Unsatisfied with the lack of color coordination and search granularity on M2M2, I decided to make 
my own M2M instead of doing stems homework. (I wanted to be able to search directories for music 
artists, mostly.) My M2M used a modified version of ffsearch for crawling and sphinx for search 
indexing, and it made requests a little more possible. It originally ran on my 1st-gen Macbook 
Pro (with corrupt RAM), and later on an iMac (donated to the school by R) with a corrupt graphics card.</p>
<p>After I left, a spry frosh took the reigns and started chopping up M2M by porting it to Django.</p>
<p>Despite the hazy ethics of M2M, the benefit it has provided to numerous Mudders who have all tried 
to re-create it in their own special way is unquestionable. It's also been the watchdog of HMC's changing 
interests and habits, and there's so much analysis you could do with its data... 
(just a start: http://i.imgur.com/iOFz3.png).</p></blockquote>

<p>Yea, you have just read the words of the Maestro, Bryce Lampe, who created the 'blue' look of 
the page you are now upon. Much has changed since his graduation in 2010, and the passing of M2M
into the hands of the next generation.</p>
<h2> SU2010 - SU2013 </h2>
<p> That spry frosh was Haak Saxberg, class of 2013, and the port to Django and Python has long since 
been completed. Although Bryce originally intended to hand M2M to a committee of
adminstrators, Haak became disillusioned with their lack of work and enthusiasm for the project.</p>
<p> The other members of the committee were not consulted in the decision-making process after the 
summer of 2010, and by the end of fall 2010, could safely be considered disbanded.</p>
<p>As it was handed down to him, like Bryce said, it was hosted from a quite pathetically
(but endearingly) disfunctional iMac, whose graphics card would only work in freezing temperatures or when
booted into safe mode. The data, which is really the treasure trove of M2M, was hosted on a school server,
for redundancy's sake. This was an important upgrade introduced by Bryce; before him, the iMac hosted 
everything about the site. Since the iMac is, at best, unstable, this was a dangerous sitation. Every day,
the risk was very real that not only the website but the file data would be lost. Moving the raw database
to a separate, backed-up server removed this fear.</p>
<p>However, the transfer of power was not as smooth as it could have been; some of the permissions
necessary to deal with certain issues were never transferred to Haak after Bryce's graduation. This caused
several service outages in the fall of 2010.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable with relying on school resources for the running of the site for numerous reasons, 
and fucking annoyed at not having the necessary permissions to fix serious issues, Haak 
decided to do something about it. Investing his sweat, blood, and tear-drenched money into the project,
he transferred all of M2M's mighty database into a more student-controlled medium.</p>
<p>M2M is no longer hosted on that iMac, nor does it use the permanent student share on
a school-owned server. It is a system of three computers: the web-crawler, which is still on that
ancient iMac, the webserver, and its own, dedicated data server. Further differences that Haak
implemented: whereas the elder version used Subversion as its version control system, M2M now uses
Git, which is better in every way; unfortunately, this also meant that it no longer has a pretty,
web-enabled repository browser. Subtle changes were also made to the styling of the page; rounded
table borders, enhanced requests, nicer form layouts, the FAQ secion, this about section,and a 
cleaner news page (with working comments!).</p>
<p>In the fall of 2010, an...extension, if you will, to M2M was created by Marquis Wang. Called M2M Movies,
it was a specialized version of M2M: tied into an external movie database, it provided metadata that the
core M2M simply did not at the time, but it only searched movies. Marquis was also the source of the
direct-serving idea, which was slow to catch on among servers but an important usability improvement.
</p>
<p> Inspired by the idea of meta-data enhanced searching, the core M2M undertook to integrate and improve
on this idea. Over the spring, summer, and fall of 2011 work progressed on including Movie, Music, and TV Show
metadata in search results, where applicable.
</p>
<p> Simultaneously, Portal was finally declared worthless - especially after a Pomona student (honestly, a 
Pomona student? Disgraceful.) created a prettier, more functional version of it. The only thing this evolved version
didn't do was actually allow you to register courses. But we wanted the searches to be sane, the display of course 
info to be sane, the use of the FUCKING BACK BUTTON. That's not too much to ask. So, M2M went to work.</p>
<p> With a great deal of help from Josiah Gaskin and Sarah Johnson, work began over the summer of 2011 on a
Mudd-ified Portal. The real goal, of course, was to beat Pomona at their own game because fuck those guys for
thinking their level is as high as ours.</p>
