Is your music not being seen? It's probably not named in a way that we recognized, or not placed in a location we can understand.
Some notes:
<ul>
<li>Everything between {}'s will be ignored.</li>
<li>Please only have the song's title in the file name, or have name it in the format <blockquote>Album - # - Artist - Title.mp3</blockquote></li>
<li>Put music in subfolders of a directory with the word "music" (case insensitive) in its name.</li>
<li>The bottom level of your music directory should look like this, for best results:<blockquote>Artist/Album/Song.mp3</blockquote></li>
</ul>
Following these guidelines will maximize our ability to catalogue your music collection.
